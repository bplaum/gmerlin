This is gmerlin, a set of multimedia libraries bundled with an application suite.

Gmerlin depends on gavl, the lower level support library. Decoding Audio/video
files is handled by gmerlin-avdecoder. Most encoding plugins are in the
gmerlin-encoders package.

This package contains the core libraries, some plugins and most applications.
For installation instructions and troubleshooting tips, read the file 
INSTALL.

The following applications are included in this package:

- GUI Media Player: Just type gmerlin to start this. It's a media player,
  which lets you access media directories, web streams, podcasts and more through
  a tree like structure.
  
- Media renderer: This is the player engine as a background service. It can be accessed
  via upnp or via the gmerlin native protocol.

- Media server: This is the media database part as a background service. It can be accessed
  by DLNA devices via Upnp or via the gmerlin native protocol.
  Also included is a web based GUI 

- Transcoder: Type gmerlin-transcoder to start this. It works very simple:
  First, add tracks to the tasklist. Then, edit options (Metadata, encoder settings...)
  for each track. The task list can then be saved for later use. After all tracks are
  configured, start transcoding.

Gmerlin is known to run on Intel Desktop systems and on the Raspberry PI 4. The media renderer
also plays audio on a headless Raspberry PI Zero W.
